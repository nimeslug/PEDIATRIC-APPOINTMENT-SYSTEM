# PEDIATRIC APPOINTMENT SYSTEM
This project is a web application developed to manage the duty schedule of pediatric assistants in a medical faculty. The application allows administrators to input assistant duty details through an admin panel, which are then displayed to the end users through a user panel in a calendar format.
